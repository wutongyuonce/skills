# trajex

Search and query Claude Code, Codex, and Pi session history from their configured local transcript roots.
Defaults are `~/.claude/`, `~/.codex/`, and Pi's `~/.pi/agent/sessions`.
Pi may additionally use a session directory selected in App Settings; the
configured value is already the final session directory, not an agent root.
Trajex does not use provider environment-variable or CLI path overrides.
Trajex indexes sessions, messages, tool calls, tool results, summaries, subagents, workflows, workflow agents, parent chains, and raw JSONL lines into SQLite + FTS5.

Trajex has three transcript sources. Treat all as ordinary sessions by default:
Claude rows use `source='claude'`; Codex and Pi rows use `source='codex'` and `source='pi'`, with provider-prefixed IDs.
Use `source` only when provenance matters or the user asks to scope to one provider.
Codex can project child agents into `subagents`.
Pi support covers official v3 session files recursively. Pi branches are projected
through `message.visibility`; there is no canonical sidechain field.

Trajex is a CodeAct memory layer: write a small JS query, run it locally, read the JSON, then answer.
Do not turn history into a flat document or browse entire sessions by default.

## Quick Start

Fast keyword search:

```bash
trajex --search "keyword"
```

Custom query:

1. Write a bounded JS query to a temp file, for example `/tmp/q.mjs`.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   trajex --query /tmp/q.mjs
   ```

3. Parse JSON stdout and answer with concise evidence.

The query file runs inside `(async () => { ... })()`.
Use `return` to emit JSON.
Query scripts are read-only: `remember()` and `forget()` are not available, and
`sql()` only accepts read-only SELECT/WITH queries.

## Sandbox Write Access

`trajex --search` and `trajex --query` refresh the index before reading it, so
the outer CLI process needs write access to `~/.trajex` or the directory named
by `TRAJEX_DIR`. The query script itself remains read-only.

If a sandbox blocks that directory, rerun the same Trajex command with write
access to the index directory. Do not fall back to reading `trajex.sqlite` or
provider JSONL files directly: that can use stale state and bypasses Trajex's
indexing and query contracts.

## Default First Pass

Start with helpers, not raw SQL. For the first Trajex query in a task, normally
call `overview({ limit: 6 })` unless the user already gave an exact
`session_id`, message `uuid`, or absolute file path.

For semantic or synthesis tasks, combine orientation, memory recall, and raw
session evidence before deciding whether a detail pass is needed:

```js
const map = overview({ limit: 6 });
const project = map.current.project?.project;
const topic = 'English topic terms translated from the user request';

return {
  orientation: map.current_project,
  prior_memories: memories({ project, query: topic, limit: 5 }),
  session_evidence: search(topic.replace(/[-_]/g, ' '), { project, limit: 8 }),
};
```

Use `sql()` only as an escalation path for exact joins, aggregations, or schema
questions that helpers cannot express cleanly. Do not use raw SQL as a generic
fallback for broad retrieval.

## Reference Map

Use references by job, not by habit:

| Reference | Use when |
|---|---|
| `references/query-patterns.md` | Scoped session resume, broad synthesis, progress summaries, design history, weekly/monthly reviews, approved memory write/archive/update scripts, or questions about what the user did/learned/decided/tried/abandoned. |
| `references/retrieval-semantics.md` | Multi-step retrieval, scoped project/file/session searches, or when scope/artifact/semantic boundaries affect query design. |
| `references/schema.md` | Raw SQL field and join quick reference before writing non-trivial `sql()`. |
| `references/api-reference.md` | Helper signatures, option names, return fields, or exact `remember()` / `forget()` parameter details are unclear. |
| `references/pitfalls.md` | Error recovery, FTS syntax, aliases, ordering, row-shape surprises, or compact/raw tradeoffs. |
## Query Routing

Before writing a query, classify the task. Progressive disclosure is useful, but
skipping the relevant reference usually costs extra query rounds.

- Read `references/query-patterns.md` before the first query for broad synthesis, progress summaries, design history, ordinary weekly/monthly reviews, or questions that ask what the user did, learned, decided, tried, or abandoned.
  Start from the first-pass or one-shot synthesis pattern, then run a faceted detail pass if needed.
- Read `references/retrieval-semantics.md` before multi-step retrieval, scoped project/file/session searches, or synthesis/conclusion/history questions.
  It defines the query design frame.
- Read `references/schema.md` before raw `sql()` unless the needed table/column relationship is already explicit here.
  It is intentionally short and SQL-focused.
  Do this before running the SQL, not after a missing-column error.
  Do not start with raw SQL for broad synthesis unless helpers cannot express the needed aggregation or join.
- Read `references/api-reference.md` when helper option names, return fields, scalar shorthand behavior, or `remember()`/`forget()` details are unclear.
- Read `references/pitfalls.md` after an error or when FTS syntax, aliases, ordering, row shapes, or compact/raw tradeoffs are unclear.

If a helper row shape is unclear, first run a tiny scoped query and return `Object.keys(row)` or a compact sample.
Do not invent field names.

For approved memory mutations, follow the Memory Layer section below first.
Use `references/query-patterns.md` for copyable `--attune` scripts
(`Attune Approved Memory`, `Forget Approved Memory`, `Update Approved Memory`),
and `references/api-reference.md` only for exact parameter semantics.

## Core API

### `search(text, opts?)`

Full-text search across main messages, subagent messages, and workflow-agent
messages.

Returns:

```js
[{ message: { uuid, text, content_type, is_meta, visibility, role, timestamp, model, cwd, source },
   session: { id, title, project, started_at, source },
   rank,
   context }]
```

`context` here means temporal neighbors: nearby messages in the same session by timestamp.
It is not the parent chain.
Use `context(uuid)` or `trace(uuid)` for causal/parent-chain context.

Use `message.content_type` to keep evidence boundaries intact:
`text` is user/assistant visible language, `thinking` is trace/debug material,
`tool_use` marks a tool-call message whose details live in `tool_calls`, and
`tool_result` marks a tool-result message whose details live in `tool_results`.
`unknown` is a conservative fallback.
Do not treat `thinking` as a user-visible assistant conclusion.
Real user input is `type='user'` plus `content_type='text'`; do not invent a separate `user_message` content type.

Use `message.is_meta` to separate transcript control-plane material from conversation evidence.
`is_meta=1` marks injected caveats, command envelopes, or other messages that entered the transcript as user-role content but should not be treated as the user's request by default.
`search()` and `thread()` omit meta messages unless `includeMeta: true` is passed; `context()` and `trace()` preserve the original chain and expose `is_meta` on rows.

`visibility` is `visible`, `inactive`, or `hidden`. Ordinary retrieval returns
`visible` rows; pass `includeInactive: true` when investigating superseded Pi
branches. `hidden` rows remain source evidence but are excluded from normal
conversation display.

Opts: `{ limit, sessionId, project, after, before, cwd, source, includeMeta, includeInactive }`.

`project` is a SQL `LIKE` filter over `sessions.project`, not an exact project identity.
Results are already ordered by FTS5 rank; lower rank sorts earlier.
Prefer returned order over manually interpreting numeric rank unless you are deliberately using FTS5 semantics.

`source` can be `'claude'`, `'codex'`, `'pi'`, or omitted. Omitted means search all indexed sources.

### `context(uuid)`

Returns the full story around one indexed message:

```js
{ message, parentChain, session, subagent, workflow }
```

Use this after `search()` finds a promising message. It is the usual way to
expand vertically from one evidence point without dumping the whole session.

### `sql(query, ...params)`

Read-only SQL SELECT/WITH with `?` placeholders. Returns array rows. SQL is an
escape hatch for exact structured joins and aggregations after the helper-first
surface is insufficient; it is not the default retrieval entry point.

Before writing non-trivial SQL, read `references/schema.md`. It is the raw SQL
field/join quick reference. The executable DDL is CLI-owned and is deliberately
not duplicated in this docs-only skill. Common safe joins:

- `tool_calls` does not have timestamps. Join `messages m ON m.uuid = tc.message_uuid`.
- `tool_results` does not have timestamps. Join `messages m ON m.uuid = tr.message_uuid`.
- For project/session filters, join `sessions s ON s.id = <table>.session_id`.
- Prefer SQL-side `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` over hand-counting in the final answer.

Tables: `sessions`, `messages`, `tool_calls`, `tool_results`, `summaries`,
`memories`, `subagents`, `workflows`, `workflow_agents`, `messages_fts`.

## Structured Helpers

These helpers are convenience accessors over the same SQLite structure. They do
not replace `sql()`, but they are the default first-pass surface. Use `sql()`
when you need an exact aggregation or a join the helper does not expose.

All list helpers accept a bounded `limit`. `limit` must be a finite
non-negative number; invalid values throw instead of becoming an unbounded
SQLite query. An explicit `sessions: []` filter matches no sessions. Many also accept:
`{ project, after, before, sessionId, sessions, branch, source }`. Check
`references/api-reference.md` or a tiny sample before relying on less common
filters or return fields.

- `overview(opts?)` -- compact orientation map. Returns current cwd/project if knowable, global project/source counts, and current-project recent sessions plus memory records. It is a map, not evidence.
- `sessions(opts?)` -- session rows, newest first. `project` is a SQL `LIKE` pattern.
- `recent(n?)` -- shorthand for recent sessions.
- `summaries(opts?)` -- summary rows, newest first: `{ id, session_id, timestamp, source, content, session_title, project }`; here `source` is the summary kind, not the transcript provider.
- `subagents(opts?)` -- subagent metadata plus `messageCount`.
- `workflows(opts?)` -- workflow runs, newest first.
- `workflowTree(runId)` -- workflow row plus parsed `result` and `agents`; may include bulky `script` and `result_json`, so project compact fields.
- `fileHistory(filePath, opts?)` -- Read/Edit/Write tool calls for a file, oldest first; includes many `Read` rows.
- `failures(opts?)` -- failed tool results with tool/session context, newest first.
- `trace(uuid)` -- parent chain from root to message.
- `thread(sessionId, opts?)` -- session messages ordered by timestamp, omitting meta and inactive messages by default. Pass `{ includeMeta: true, includeInactive: true }` when investigating injected context or superseded Pi branches.
- `raw(uuid, opts?)` -- windowed access to the original JSONL line; `offset` and
  `limit` must be finite non-negative numbers.
- `memories(opts?)` -- recall memory layer. opts: `{ query, project, sessionId, sessions, after, before, branch, limit }`. Without `query`, returns active memory records newest first. With `query`, searches `summary`/`path` through safe FTS5 tokenization and returns `rank`; lower rank sorts earlier. Read the file at `path` for full content.

## Retrieval Contract

Keep queries scoped, bounded, and structural.

- Scope First: classify the locator as scope, artifact, or semantic. Use the narrowest structural locator before FTS; empty scoped results are valid unless the user asks to broaden.
- Orient First: for a new task, normally call `overview({ limit: 6 })` before deeper retrieval unless the user gave an exact session/message/file locator. It is a navigation map; confirm facts with `memories()`, `search()`, helpers, or, only when needed, `sql()`.
- Helper First: prefer `overview()`, `memories()`, `search()`, `sessions()`, `summaries()`, `fileHistory()`, and other helpers for first-pass retrieval. Escalate to raw `sql()` only when helpers cannot express the needed join, grouping, or exact schema-level check.
- Plan Before Probe: for conclusion, broad history, failure investigation, or file evolution, write a bounded retrieval script instead of spending turns on intermediate results.
- Structure Before Text: compute counts, joins, grouping, dedupe, and projection in SQL or JS; keep runtime JSON compact, ideally under 10k-12k chars for synthesis tasks.
- Return Budget: treat helper results as internal data. Before returning, keep only the rows, fields, and text needed for the answer. Raw returns are acceptable only for small, exactly scoped results.
- Evidence Before Conclusion: return compact evidence with stable IDs (`session_id`, `uuid`, `tool_call_id`, `run_id`, `agent_id`) and short snippets, then synthesize in the final answer.
- Exclude Meta By Default: `is_meta=1` rows are injected/control-plane transcript material. Helpers hide them by default; raw SQL for ordinary conversation evidence should include `COALESCE(m.is_meta,0)=0` unless meta rows are the investigation target.
- Persist Durable Conclusions: after answering, if retrieval produced a durable conclusion that future sessions are likely to reuse and `memories()` does not already cover it, explicitly offer to write a memory. Keep the offer brief. Do not write the markdown file or run `--attune` until the user approves.

If field, context, ordering, FTS, or helper semantics affect the query, read
`references/retrieval-semantics.md` before coding. If a query errors, read
`references/pitfalls.md` before retrying.

## Memory Layer

Trajex has a persistent memory layer alongside raw session data.
Every retrieval queries both layers: `memories()` for prior conclusions, `search()` and helpers for raw session evidence.
Use memory as prior notes, not final authority.
If a memory record influences your answer, say naturally that it was previously recorded, and compare it with raw session evidence when correctness depends on it.
Raw session data is the evidence layer, but one hit is not a complete truth; query and cite it compactly.

The memory layer is English-indexed.
Use English terms in `memories({ query })` even when the user asks in another language.
Write every `remember().summary` in English, regardless of the current conversation language.
The runtime rejects obvious CJK text in memory queries and summaries as a guardrail.

**Recall:** query `memories({ query: 'English topic terms', project: '...' })` to find prior conclusions relevant to the current task.
Translate non-English user requests into concise English query terms before calling `memories()`.
Memory recall uses safe FTS5 tokenization over `summary` and `path`, so hyphens/punctuation are tokenized instead of causing raw `MATCH` syntax errors.
Like other list helpers, passing a string is treated as `sessionId`, and passing a number is treated as `limit`.
Read the file at `path` for full content.
`memories()` returns active memories only.
An archived memory is management/audit data, not recall data.

Good memory candidates include design decisions, project conventions, abandoned alternatives, repeated failure causes, workflow patterns, and conclusions synthesized across multiple raw evidence points.
Do not propose memory for one-off lookups, uncertain findings, or conclusions already covered by existing memories.

**Mutation approvals:** judging whether to use a memory in the current answer is an agent decision and does not require approval.
Persistent memory changes do.
If the user explicitly says a memory is wrong, outdated, should be forgotten, or should now say something else, that request is the approval to archive or update the exact matching memory.
Do not ask for a second confirmation unless multiple memories could match.
If you notice a possible conflict yourself, explain it briefly and ask before changing memory state.

**Writing memories:** after a retrieval produces a conclusion worth persisting,
propose writing a memory file. The user must approve. Flow:

1. Write a markdown file using the `Write` tool (user approves).
2. Register it via `remember()` in a narrow memory-registration script:

```js
return remember({
  path: '.trajex/memories/design-decision-x.md',
  session_id: 'current-session-id',
  message_start: 'uuid-of-first-relevant-msg',
  message_end: 'uuid-of-last-relevant-msg',
  summary: 'Detailed summary: what was decided, why, what alternatives were considered, and what constraints drove the choice.'
})
```

Run the registration script with:

```bash
trajex --attune /tmp/register-memory.mjs
```

`--attune` exposes only memory mutation helpers: `remember()` and `forget()`.
It does not expose `search()`, `sql()`, `memories()`, or other retrieval
helpers. If you need source IDs or memory IDs, find them first with a normal
`--query` script.

`remember()` validates that `path` already exists and points to a file. Relative
paths are resolved against the source session's `project_path` when
`session_id` is provided, then stored as normalized absolute paths. Prefer
project-relative paths such as `.trajex/memories/...` plus `session_id`.
`summary` must be English and detailed enough that `memories()` results alone
can judge relevance without reading the file. Include the decision, the
reasoning, and the key constraints — not just a title.

The `message_start`/`message_end` range marks where in the conversation this
conclusion was drawn. Use it later to trace back to the original evidence.

**Forgetting memories:** if the user says a memory is outdated, wrong, or should
be forgotten, use normal recall first to identify the exact memory ID. If there
is exactly one clear candidate, the user's request is approval to archive it. If
multiple memories could match, ask which one to forget. Then run an `--attune`
script:

```js
return forget({
  id: 'mem-id-to-delete',
  reason: 'Outdated by newer project guidance.',
});
```

`forget()` archives the memory record by setting `deleted_at` and
`deleted_reason`. It removes the record from active recall but does not delete
the markdown file. Memory records survive index rebuilds and are never changed
automatically.

**Updating memories:** updating memory is one user-approved operation:
archive the old memory with `forget()`, then write and register a replacement
markdown memory with `remember()`. If the user explicitly corrected the memory,
that correction is approval for the combined archive-plus-write flow. If you
discovered the mismatch yourself, ask first.

## Minimal Patterns

Search, then expand one promising hit:

```js
const hits = search('auth fix', { limit: 5 });
if (!hits.length) return [];
return hits.slice(0, 3).map(h => ({
  session_id: h.session.id,
  session_title: h.session.title,
  uuid: h.message.uuid,
  snippet: h.message.text?.slice(0, 240),
}));
```

Check helper fields before assuming names:

```js
const rows = summaries({ project: '%quiet-zero%', limit: 1 });
return rows.length ? Object.keys(rows[0]) : [];
```

Fetch message neighbors without a full thread:

```js
const hit = search('runtime query', { limit: 1 })[0];
return sql(
  `SELECT uuid, role, timestamp, substr(text,1,240) AS snippet
   FROM messages
   WHERE session_id=? AND timestamp>=?
   ORDER BY timestamp LIMIT 6`,
  hit.session.id,
  hit.message.timestamp
);
```

See `references/query-patterns.md` for longer recipes.

## Notes

- First run builds the index. Later runs update incrementally.
- DB location: `~/.trajex/trajex.sqlite`; old `~/.claude/trajex.sqlite` is copied forward if needed.
- Query scripts run in a sandboxed VM with no filesystem or network access from inside the script.
- Ordinary indexed text and tool inputs are capped at 10k chars. Tool-result messages keep a 1k head-tail preview, while `tool_results.content` keeps up to 10k head-tail chars. Use `raw(uuid, { offset, limit })` for specific JSONL windows.
